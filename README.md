##Workflow

Code and Design Convention
  - Ruby: https://github.com/airbnb/ruby
  - JavaScript: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript

Code review before merging code into master

  - Git master reviews code before merging into master
  - Rebase feature branch before submitting pull requests

Deployment after merging a feature into master

  - Push early and often
  - Not sure if we can push to Heroku - HTTPS needed to run in web browser

Sync ups as needed

  - Every 2 hours during working hours

##Product Vision

Clearly define what is the product at the end of 5 days

  - Create account
  - Start a new presentation and show real-time analytics
  - See analytics of past presentations

One sentence description

Presentation analytics tool that helps presenters capture, monitor and track the audience's emotional reaction to their content in real-time.

User stories

  - User can create an account
  - User can edit their account
  - User can login and logout
  - User can create a new presentation
  - User can start a new presentation
  - User can monitor the emotional reaction to an in-progress presentation
  - User can view analytics about past presentations

  * User need to be able to connect an external camera

Stretch

  - Users can record presentation audio and compare it to graphs
  - User can get recommendations during an in-progress presentation on how to better engage the audience
  - Sign in with Facebook (potentially add post about the presentation to their timeline)
  - Look into using Devise?

Tasks

  - Create our preliminary app in Rails and push to Heroku (team)
  - Research image capture storage via AWS S3 (Amanda) - 2 hours
  - Research JavaScript libraries for charts and presentation analytics (Roman) - 2 hours
  - Research connecting external web cam to computer (Tyler) - 2 hours

Debbie's Suggestions

  - Make sure we can use our app with Heroku
  - Goal is MVP by Monday morning - we will show the other groups what we've done
  - Make sure we are focusing on the core concept before building other things
  - Make sure that we're not adding the log files when we commit - don't use git add .
